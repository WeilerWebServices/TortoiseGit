		Commit each diff from a specified head directly to the SVN repository,
		and then rebase or reset (depending on whether or not there is a diff between SVN and head).
		This will create a revision in SVN for each commit in git. It is recommended that you run
		git-svn fetch and rebase (not pull or merge) your commits against the latest changes in
		the SVN repository.

		<guilabel>Git Style Commit (--rmdir)</guilabel>: Remove directories from the SVN tree
		if there are no files left behind. SVN can version empty directories, and they are
		not removed by default if there are no files left in them. git cannot version empty
		directories. Enabling this flag will make the commit to SVN act like git.
