<title>DESCRIPTION</title>
<simpara>Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository.</simpara>
<simpara>A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to check
out more than one branch at a time.  With <emphasis>git worktree add</emphasis> a new working
tree is associated with the repository.  This new working tree is called a
"linked working tree" as opposed to the "main working tree" prepared by "git
init" or "git clone".  A repository has one main working tree (if it's not a
bare repository) and zero or more linked working trees.</simpara>
<simpara>When you are done with a linked working tree you can simply delete it.
The working tree's administrative files in the repository (see
"DETAILS" below) will eventually be removed automatically (see
<emphasis>gc.worktreePruneExpire</emphasis> in <xref linkend="git-config(1)" />), or you can run
<emphasis>git worktree prune</emphasis> in the main or any linked working tree to
clean up any stale administrative files.</simpara>
<simpara>If you move a linked working tree, you need to manually update the
administrative files so that they do not get pruned automatically. See
section "DETAILS" for more information.</simpara>
<simpara>If a linked working tree is stored on a portable device or network share
which is not always mounted, you can prevent its administrative files from
being pruned by creating a file named <emphasis>locked</emphasis> alongside the other
administrative files, optionally containing a plain text reason that
pruning should be suppressed. See section "DETAILS" for more information.</simpara>

<simplesect id="git-worktree(1)__details">
<title>DETAILS</title>
<simpara>Each linked working tree has a private sub-directory in the repository's
$GIT_DIR/worktrees directory.  The private sub-directory's name is usually
the base name of the linked working tree's path, possibly appended with a
number to make it unique.  For example, when <emphasis>$GIT_DIR=/path/main/.git</emphasis> the
command <emphasis>git worktree add /path/other/test-next next</emphasis> creates the linked
working tree in <emphasis>/path/other/test-next</emphasis> and also creates a
<emphasis>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next</emphasis> directory (or <emphasis>$GIT_DIR/worktrees/test-next1</emphasis>
if <emphasis>test-next</emphasis> is already taken).</simpara>
<simpara>Within a linked working tree, $GIT_DIR is set to point to this private
directory (e.g. <emphasis>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</emphasis> in the example) and
$GIT_COMMON_DIR is set to point back to the main working tree's $GIT_DIR
(e.g. <emphasis>/path/main/.git</emphasis>). These settings are made in a <emphasis>.git</emphasis> file located at
the top directory of the linked working tree.</simpara>
<simpara>Path resolution via <emphasis>git rev-parse --git-path</emphasis> uses either
$GIT_DIR or $GIT_COMMON_DIR depending on the path. For example, in the
linked working tree <emphasis>git rev-parse --git-path HEAD</emphasis> returns
<emphasis>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/HEAD</emphasis> (not
<emphasis>/path/other/test-next/.git/HEAD</emphasis> or <emphasis>/path/main/.git/HEAD</emphasis>) while <emphasis>git
rev-parse --git-path refs/heads/master</emphasis> uses
$GIT_COMMON_DIR and returns <emphasis>/path/main/.git/refs/heads/master</emphasis>,
since refs are shared across all working trees.</simpara>
<simpara>See <xref linkend="gitrepository-layout(5)" /> for more information. The rule of
thumb is do not make any assumption about whether a path belongs to
$GIT_DIR or $GIT_COMMON_DIR when you need to directly access something
inside $GIT_DIR. Use <emphasis>git rev-parse --git-path</emphasis> to get the final path.</simpara>
<simpara>If you move a linked working tree, you need to update the <emphasis>gitdir</emphasis> file
in the entry's directory. For example, if a linked working tree is moved
to <emphasis>/newpath/test-next</emphasis> and its <emphasis>.git</emphasis> file points to
<emphasis>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</emphasis>, then update
<emphasis>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/gitdir</emphasis> to reference <emphasis>/newpath/test-next</emphasis>
instead.</simpara>
<simpara>To prevent a $GIT_DIR/worktrees entry from being pruned (which
can be useful in some situations, such as when the
entry's working tree is stored on a portable device), add a file named
<emphasis>locked</emphasis> to the entry's directory. The file contains the reason in
plain text. For example, if a linked working tree's <emphasis>.git</emphasis> file points
to <emphasis>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next</emphasis> then a file named
<emphasis>/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/locked</emphasis> will prevent the
<emphasis>test-next</emphasis> entry from being pruned.  See
<xref linkend="gitrepository-layout(5)" /> for details.</simpara>
</simplesect>
<simplesect id="git-worktree(1)__list_output_format">
<title>LIST OUTPUT FORMAT</title>
<simpara>The worktree list command has two output formats.  The default format shows the
details on a single line with columns.  For example:</simpara>
<screen>S git worktree list
/path/to/bare-source            (bare)
/path/to/linked-worktree        abcd1234 [master]
/path/to/other-linked-worktree  1234abc  (detached HEAD)</screen>
<section id="git-worktree(1)__porcelain_format">
<title>Porcelain Format</title>
<simpara>The porcelain format has a line per attribute.  Attributes are listed with a
label and value separated by a single space.  Boolean attributes (like <emphasis>bare</emphasis>
and <emphasis>detached</emphasis>) are listed as a label only, and are only present if and only
if the value is true.  An empty line indicates the end of a worktree.  For
example:</simpara>
<screen>S git worktree list --porcelain
worktree /path/to/bare-source
bare

worktree /path/to/linked-worktree
HEAD abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234abcd1234
branch refs/heads/master

worktree /path/to/other-linked-worktree
HEAD 1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234abc1234a
detached</screen>

<simpara>You are in the middle of a refactoring session and your boss comes in and
demands that you fix something immediately. You might typically use
<xref linkend="git-stash(1)" /> to store your changes away temporarily, however, your
working tree is in such a state of disarray (with new, moved, and removed
files, and other bits and pieces strewn around) that you don't want to risk
disturbing any of it. Instead, you create a temporary linked working tree to
make the emergency fix, remove it when done, and then resume your earlier
refactoring session.</simpara>
<screen>$ git worktree add -b emergency-fix ../temp master
