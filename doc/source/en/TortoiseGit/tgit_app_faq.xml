			Because TortoiseGit is being developed all the time
			it is sometimes hard to keep the documentation completely
			up to date.

			<ulink url="https://tortoisegit.org/faq">
				<citetitle>online FAQ</citetitle>
			</ulink>

			which contains a selection of the questions we are asked
			the most on the TortoiseGit mailing lists
			<email>tortoisegit-dev@googlegroups.com</email> and
			<email>tortoisegit-users@googlegroups.com</email>.

		<para>
			We also maintain a project
			<ulink url="https://tortoisegit.org/issues">
				<citetitle>Issue Tracker</citetitle>
			</ulink>
			which tells you about some of the things we have on our To-Do list,
			and bugs which have already been fixed. If you think you have found
			a bug, or want to request a new feature, check here first to see
			if someone else got there before you.

			If you have a question which is not answered anywhere
			else, the best place to ask it is on one of the mailing lists.
			<email>tortoisegit-users@googlegroups.com</email> is the one to use
			if you have questions about using TortoiseGit.
			If you want to help out with the development of TortoiseGit,
			then you should take part in discussions on
			<email>tortoisegit-dev@googlegroups.com</email>.
