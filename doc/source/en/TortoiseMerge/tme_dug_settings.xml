		<para>
			Most of the options here are self-explanatory, but a few
			points need clarifying.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Backup original file</guilabel>
			renames the original file in the WC to <literal>filename.bak</literal>
			before saving the modified version.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Default to UTF-8 encoding</guilabel>
			when set, ANSI files are loaded as UTF-8 encoded and saved as
			such when edited.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Use ribbons</guilabel>
			when set, ribbons interface is used (looks like Office 2007).
			When unset, traditional toolbar interface is used.
			Default is set.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Use spaces</guilabel>
			when set, pressing tab key inserts spaces.
			Default is unset (tab char is used).
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Smart tab char</guilabel>
			when set, pressing tab key inserts tab/spaces based on adjacent lines/characters.
			Default is unset.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>EditorConfig</guilabel>
			when set, it will detect <literal>.editorconfig</literal> files.
			Currently, it supports indent_style(space/tab) and indent_size properties.
			See <ulink url="http://editorconfig.org/"><citetitle>EditorConfig</citetitle></ulink> website for more details.

		<para>
			<guilabel>Max line length for inline diffs</guilabel>
			TortoiseGitMerge can get slow when showing inline diffs for
			very long lines. Because of that only lines that are shorter
			than 3000 chars are shown with inline diffs. You can change
			this value here.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Ignore line endings</guilabel>
			hides changes which are due solely to difference in line-end style.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Ignore case changes</guilabel>
			hides changes which are due solely to case changes within the text.
			This can be useful with apps such as Visual Basic, which changes
			case in variables without warning.
		</para>
		<para>
			<guilabel>Context lines for patches</guilabel>
			specifies how many context lines for patch files generated from TortoiseGitMerge.
			The default value is -1, which means context lines number is controlled
			by git or <literal>diff.context</literal> config.
