Grabbing Screenshots for TortoiseGit Docs
=========================================
This file is a guide to grabbing screenshots for the user manual.
Although there are not many hard and fast rules, some screenshots need
care to set up as they are demonstrating a range of features.

To help with consistency, some of these instructions are presented
as a TortoiseGitProc.exe command line. These assume that the TGit
bin directory is in the PATH and that you have a doc folder checked
out at D:\TortoiseGit\Doc. Adjust the path according to your location.

From the images directory you can simply run adjustimages to check all
images in all languages - it could take a long time. You can check
specific languages or images using a single parameter, eg.
adjustimages en\*.png
adjustimages en\Rev*.png


General rules for all screenshots
=================================
Use PNG format
8 bit colour depth (256 colours, done by adjustimages.bat)
Windows 7 style preferred, white background, English Windows (especially for Context Menus)
Use the D:\TortoiseGit repository
If you update a Screenshot please make sure it looks quite similar to the existing one
